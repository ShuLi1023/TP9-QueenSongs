# Getting Started with Create React App

You will need to create a simple interface composed of:
-	An input field. When you will type something inside this field, you will display under it an autocompleted list of songs containing what you typed. All the songs are defined in the provided songs.js file.
-	When you click on one song from the autocompletion list, it will select the song and add it in a list you need to display elsewhere in your page.
-	When you click on a song already selected (whether from the autocompletion list or your selected songs list), it will unselect the song.
-	Finally, you will need to add a button Validate which will display all the songs you have selected in an alert, separated by “, “.
All the design/ergonomics choices are all yours, as usual. Everything must be developed using React.
